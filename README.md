# shr-rest-api
Swagger JSON file and YAML file for creating SHR REST API

This repository contains the JSON and YAML files that can be used to generate REST APIs for the Standard Health Record.

## Updating this repository
Either the JSON or YAML file can be used to define and generate REST APIs. Both files are not strictly needed. Both files are included in this repository for convenience. If one file is updated, be sure to generate the other file so that both files are always up to date. The Swagger Online Editor can download both versions of the file.

### Tools
The files can be used to generate code using the Swagger online editor, which can be found at https://editor.swagger.io/, or using other Swagger code generation tools.
